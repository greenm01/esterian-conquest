# Esterian Conquest v2.0
Esterian Conquest is a 4x, asynchronous, multiplayer, spaced-based empire building strategy game originally released circa 1992 by Bentley C. Griffith. 

A popular BBS DOOR game from a time before the internet as we know it, EC was almost lost to the sands of time... 

This is a fan made resurection, written in Odin lang, that you can play (hopefully someday soon, lol) with your nerd friends.

STATUS: Work in progress. Not yet playable.
